Name: Popa Razvan Mihai;
Group: 323CC;
Homework difficulty: medium;
Time allocated: 2-3 weeks with breaks;

Implementation:

• Catalog class
    -> using Singleton Design Pattern

• User, Student, Parent, Assistant, Teacher classes
    -> Factory Design Pattern, UserFactory class returns specific User
    -> added toString() method

• Grade class
    -> fields: partialScore, examScore, student, course
    -> implements Comparable, Cloneable, wrote clone and compareTo
    -> setter, getter methods
    -> getTotal: we sum up partialScore and examScore

• Group class
    -> inherits a Student Arraylist
    -> i added a Comparator field which gets updated in the constructor;
    we later could use it if we wanted to sort the students by their name;
    implemented NameSorter class as Comparator for this;

• Course class
    -> abstract class, implemented all methods
    -> added a String strategy variable to use it for getBestStudent

• Partial course/Full course classes
    -> inherits Course, getGraduatedStudents differs.

• For the courses, we had to implement CourseBuilder and then
FullCourseBuilder and PartialCourseBuilder. (Builder Design Pattern)

• Observer Design Pattern
    -> the Notification class stores a grade and has a specific message for each parent,
    depending on the student, course, type of exam
    -> Catalog implements Subject;
    i created a list of observers in Catalog and the specified methods;
    -> Parent implements Observer;
    a notification is sent to the parent and added into an arraylist of notifications
    for later usage in the parent UI;

• Strategy Design Pattern
    -> created a BestScoreStrategy interface and 3 separate classes who select the best
    student depending on their grades;

• Visitor Design Pattern
    -> addExamScore & addPartialScore methods adds a Tuple to the map
    -> visit: get each entry of the map, iterate through courses and store the value for
    each entry; for each course, check if it contains the Assistant/Teacher & if the course
    name is the same as the tuple one; create a grade with the tuple given, set its Score
    and add the grade in the Course (modifying the existing grade with no Score set)
    and notifyObservers;
    -> in NotifyObservers iterate through the observers ArrayList, create a Notification
    and if the observer is the student's paren, call update;
    -> in update print the Notification and add it to the Notification ArrayList

• Memento Design Pattern
    -> created Snapshot class which stores an arraylist of grades
    -> implemented makeBackup() which clones every grade in the snapshot grades
    -> implemented undo() which changes the value of the course grades with the
    backup ones from Snapshot

• Student Page
    -> constructor receives a Student;
    -> used BorderLayout, at the top placing the name of the student
    -> in the center, there is a message and a list of courses
    -> if you select a course a new frame opens up with details about the course

• Teacher/Assistant Page
    -> constructor receives an User, its type, the visitor
    -> same layout as Student Page, except in the center we list the courses of the
    Teacher/Assistant and a list of tuples
    -> if you press the validate grades button they are added in the catalog and
    notifications are sent

• Parent Page
    -> constructor receives a Parent
    -> if you press Check Notifications a new frame opens with a list of the notifications
    sent to the parent

• Login Page
    -> used a frame who helped me build a frame that pleases me aesthetically
    -> added an image to be cuter
    -> the password is not seen
    -> User is User.toString() and i chose the passwords this way:
        -- for Teachers/Assistants i added a "password" field in the json file
        and gave them original ones
        -- for students and parents their passwords are User.toString()+"123"
        (for example: Student - Gigel Frone | User: "Gigel Frone" | Pass: "Gigel Frone123")
    -> after login, the specific user's page is opened.

• Testing and allocating values for variables
    -> I tested with the values from a JSON file
    -> In the Test class the methods and interfaces are tested
